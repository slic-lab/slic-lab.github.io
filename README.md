# Sherbrooke Laboratory for Integrative Connectomics | SLIC
Welcome!

We are the Sherbrooke Laboratory for Integrative Connectomics (SLIC) and are located in the Pavillon de santÃ© de prÃ©cision et de recherche translationnelle on the health campus of the Universite de Sherbrooke.

Our research combines neuroimaging, computational statistics, machine learning, and pipeline development to deepen our understanding of the human brain. We develop and apply neuroinformatics and data science methods to study typical and atypical brain development, aiming to improve personalized prognostics and treatment, and ultimately, influence public health policies.

We speak ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· and ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§!
